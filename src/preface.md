## PREFACE


This update of the 1992–1995 _Guide_ _to_ _the_ _Enigma_ has been in the works for so long that some of its revisions have had to be revised.  Apart from that, the Forms section has been entirely redone; the Glossary is brand new to this edition; and we have new flat types and new extra types, along with many other changes throughout.

 

Thanks go to all the original contributors. Thanks to a number of Krewe who added anything from a definition to an entire section: Brillig, Hot, Lunch Boy, Mercury, Philana, Qaqaq, Quip, Saxifrage, Treesong, XEIPWN, Xemu.  And to President Tyger for inspiration and patience.

 

Over the last few months, Brillig and Treesong proofed, copyedited, commented, and in general saved me from a thousand errors of style or content. (The remaining errors are mine.) I can't thank them enough for their intelligence, expertise, and generosity.  And Smaug took on the final work of design, making the pages readable, renumbering, and reprinting.

Thanks to Mercury for formatting the _Guide to the Enigma_ so that Smaug can print it as a single booklet. A few cosmetic changes have been made, but it is essentially unchanged.
