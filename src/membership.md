## Membership

by Hudu, Brillig, Treesong, and Sibyl

**_Noms_**

When you join the League, you may choose a nom de plume, or "nom" for short. Though it's not required, most of our members do so, and we address each other by noms in correspondence and conversation. The tradition of adopting noms in puzzle clubs is a very old one, predating even the League itself. Practically, noms serve as the best of all possible nicknames, for each of us can choose our own. Symbolically, noms allow all puzzlers to meet as equals, free of the titles and social distinctions that the outside world may demand. An eighteen-year-old student can address a fifty-year-old neurosurgeon without wondering if it's "First Name" or "Dr. Last Name." Our noms are the only introduction needed to NPL members all over the world.

Members have settled on their noms in countless ways. When making new acquaintances in the League, a good conversation starter is to ask the meaning of their noms. Some members simply choose a favorite nickname. Others adopt the names of literary or historical characters. Some noms are words that have personal significance. Some involve anagrams or reversals, and several are derived by methods of breathtaking complexity. And a few members have excited curiosity by politely declining to explain their noms at all.

You can download the latest edition of Faro's _NPL Nom List_ from the NPL site or ask the treasurer for the most up-to-date nom list, if you'd like to see which noms have been chosen from the NPL's inception.

When you choose a nom, inform the treasurer, who will verify that the nom doesn't duplicate an existing one. The treasurer will forward your nom selection to the editor, who will announce it in _The Enigma_, with a description or explanation if you provide one.

Always use real names on envelopes when you write the editor or correspond with other members. Don't count on letter carriers' realizing that the Ms. Walker in Apt. 4 is also Plum Pudding.

**_Subscriptions_**

Membership in the National Puzzlers' League includes a subscription to _The Enigma_, whose masthead gives membership rates and information on how to join. 

When you join, you will receive the three most recent _Enigma_ issues at one time—you will be able to compare puzzles in the two-month-old issue with their published answers in the current one. Most beginners have found this a helpful way to learn the basics of solving. The two extra issues don't count against your first year's subscription.

New members also receive this _Guide to The Enigma_ and the most recent directory of members.

Non-print  memberships are available at a reduced rate.; you'll download monthly issues from the NPL site. If you join with this option, you can download the _Guide to The Enigma_, the recent directory, and past issues from the NPL site.  

If you have a real interest in puzzling and can't afford NPL membership dues, you may apply to the treasurer for a reduced rate or a full "scholarship." Students and others on fixed incomes occasionally make use of this opportunity; some members are able to reimburse the League later on. (Some members have earmarked their donations for these scholarships.) Some indication of your continuing interest—_Enigma_ puzzles, solution lists, even a letter to the treasurer—is requested during the year. 

**_Renewals_**

The mailing label on your _Enigma_ envelope shows the date of the last issue of your current subscription. The message "PLEASE RENEW" will appear on the mailing label of the last three issues in your subscription. To avoid missing an issue, be sure to renew no later than the day you receive the last issue of your current subscription. (Early and multiyear renewals are encouraged and appreciated.) If you are a longtime member or have a non-print membership, the treasurer will send a renewal reminder by e-mail.

**_Internet_**

The NPL's older Web site at `www.puzzlers.org` contains a wealth of information for members, including an online version of this_ Guide_, descriptions of all the puzzle types currently being composed, and members' stories of how they joined and chose their noms. Some areas of the site are restricted to members only and are password-protected. 

To get access to the members-only pages, you need to register and the treasurer will then activate your username. (To register, click the Login button in the lower-right of the screen, and then on the next page that appears click the green Register link just below the Login box. Fill in the requested information on the next screen, and the system will automatically send you a message with a password. If you don't receive the message within an hour or two because your ISP blocks it or you have a spam filter that tosses it, send the treasurer a message with your username.) Most members use their noms as their usernames, but any unique username will do, and your username and your nom don't have to be the same. Usernames are forced by the puzzlers.org site to all lowercase, but noms are usually initial capped, just like all proper nouns.

The NPL Webmasters are developing new sites (`krewe.puzzlers.org`, `enigma.puzzlers.org`, and `con.puzzlers.`o`rg` so far), and both the old/new sites will co-exist for some time, each with its own set of ids/passwords.

You can also get an NPL e-mail alias (typically, `yournom@puzzlers.org`). This is a forwarding address directing mail to your existing e-mail account; `plumpudding@puzzlers.org` is more easily remembered than `awalker9873@fishwash.net`—and will certainly make it easier for fellow Krewe to remember how to reach you. To obtain your NPL e-mail alias, write to `postmaster@puzzlers.org` with your nom and e-mail address.

In addition, some members subscribe to the NPL e-mail list, where they can post messages for other subscribers to see. To subscribe, send an e-mail message with your nom and e-mail address to `postmaster@puzzlers.org`. (Messages to the list itself are sent to `npl-folk@puzzlers.org`.) If you wish to receive only announcements from board members, send a message with the same information but specify you want to subscribe to `npl-announce` instead of `npl-folk`.

**_Minisample_**

The minisample is a four-page sampler of easy puzzles from _The Enigma_. It's a good introduction to our puzzles, and you're welcome to give copies to friends who might enjoy the NPL. You can also include it with notices of local meetings or articles about the NPL for newspapers or other puzzle publications. Minisamples are free and available on our Web site.

Prospective joiners who have never seen an _Enigma_ or minisample may confuse us with a contest organization or expect to find crossword puzzles. Or they may not realize that our members contribute puzzles to _The Enigma_ without pay. To avoid disappointment or misunderstanding, please give friends the minisample to show them our puzzles. Articles about the NPL should direct readers to our Web site.

**_Directory_**

The League publishes an annual directory of all members. It lists noms, names, and addresses along with other information if you request it: telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, office phone numbers, vacation addresses. 

Additional copies of the directory are available from the NPL site..

**_Contact Information Changes_**

Send directory information changes as soon as possible to the treasurer, whose address is on _The Enigma_'_s_ masthead. Mailing labels are provided to the printer about two weeks before each issue is sent; address changes received after that will not go into effect until the following issue.
