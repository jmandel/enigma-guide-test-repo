## Verse

by Sibyl

 

Read your verse out loud, with completely natural phrasing. Don't try to make it fit the meter, just read it and see where the stresses naturally fall. (Remember, to write verse does not mean to lose the ability to make sense or to speak English.)

If the verse doesn't have a regular pattern (stresses every second or third syllable, most often), rewrite for a more satisfying thump.

 

Change:	HAPpy BIRTHday to you, GUYS

to:		HAPpy BIRTHday, GUYS, to YOU

 

Change:	a CAStle is at the TOP of the HILL

to:		a CAStle stands TALL at the TOP of the HILL

or:		at the TOP of the HILL is a CAStle

 

Some variation in the regular stress pattern is likely (see verse above): "THOSE of the LARgest SIZE," or "HOLDing his POCKet HANDkerchief"—in light verse, like ours, only once in a while. Don't vary the pattern so that the line reads awkwardly; don't use two variations in a row—you'll get prose.

Keep the same number of beats in each line. (Or alternate odd lines with even ones a stress shorter.)


### _Rhyme_

_Enigma_ verse almost always rhymes. Most common are couplets (aa bb), quatrains with alternately rhyming lines (abab), or quatrains with even-line rhyme only (abcb). Rhyme depends on stressed sounds (never on spelling) that match except for their first consonant (actually the first phoneme: all/fall).

These are rhymes: hard/card; word/deferred; doggerel/ hoggerel; or (see above) sympathize/size, using the secondary stress of the three-syllable word. These are not rhymes: card/diehard (_LIE hard_ rhymes with _DIE hard_); howler/bowler (spelling doesn't count); beaut/swimsuit (no "secondary stress" in a two-syllable word); male/female.

If you're willing to read (aloud, of course) a lot of verse, you'll write better stuff. If you're willing to read just a little, try _The New Oxford Book of Light Verse_, edited by Kingsley Amis; or try some other light-verse anthology. Or look in the library for verse by Dorothy Parker, W. H. Auden, Samuel Hoffenstein, Phyllis McGinley, Felicia Lamport, or someone else you like. Verse is to be enjoyed. Enjoy!
