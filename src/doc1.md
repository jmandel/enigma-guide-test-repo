# Flats by Hudu, Brillig, Treesong, and Sibyl


## Acrostical enigma

Through an alphabetical quirk, the first puzzle in our list is also among the hardest to master. If you're reading this _Guide_ for the first time, we recommend learning about the other flat types first, returning here when you've had more practice.

The solution to an acrostical enigma, or AE for short, is a word or phrase. This solution is divided into chunks of two or more letters each; each chunk is clued in a different couplet in an unusual way. The chunk plus the first two or more letters of the couplet form a word or phrase (called the "part-word") that is clued somewhere within the couplet itself. A final couplet clues the entire solution.

    ACROSTICAL ENIGMA (10)
    A.	Relaxing on Saturday morning I am;
        I smell something burning, but who gives a damn?

    B.	Gargantuan flames billow smoke in the air;
        Some building is blazing, but why should I care?

    C.	I only want something absorbing to read.
        A Harlequin tearjerker: just what I need!

    D.	Red engines zip by with complete audibility,
        Disturbing, with bells, my beloved tranquility.

        It's getting quite warm now. What can be the matter?
        Let's turn up the fan and ignore all the clatter!
        
        =Hudu

In part A, the letters AFI plus the letters RE from the beginning of the couplet form the part-word _afire_, which is clued by "burning." The first chunk of the solution is AFI.

The remaining part-words are: _CI-gar_ ("smoke"), _ON-ion_ ("tearjerker"), _ADO-red_ ("beloved"). Putting all the chunks together—AFI, CI, ON, ADO—produces the solution: _aficionado_ (clued by "fan" in the final couplet). (Saving space on the solutions page, this entire solution would appear simply as "AFIre, CIgar, ONion, ADOred.")

In an AE, only the full solution is enumerated. Both the part-words and the full solution are tagged when necessary, and hyphenated words or phrases among the part-words are noted.

Misleading clues are common in acrostical enigmas. Be on guard for words that have other meanings (like "fan" in the above example) or that can be used as parts of speech other than those used in the verse.

Definitions can be phrases, too. In one acrostical enigma, the solution was _bodhisattva_, and the definition ("future_ _Buddha") was concealed in this final couplet:

    Each hopes to live, with verve and vim,
    The future Buddha plans for him.
    =Hudu

Punctuation may be misleading. In one acrostical enigma (with a verse about the Three Stooges), the solution was _pertussis_, and the definition ("whooping_ _cough") was deceptively hidden in this final couplet:

    Curly will start "whoop-whoop-whoop"-ing,
    Cough up feathers, get kicked while stooping.
    =Kremlin

 

The entire couplet may indicate the solution or part-word, rather than any single word or phrase, as in this couplet clueing _BY-PROduct_:

    Ductile is my mind from drink;
    Gin also shows me gnus (in pink).
    =Eric

The gnus here are a by-product of the gin and so refer to the part-word. This sort of clue isn't used often; almost always the couplet has a direct definition of the part-word.

Also used are couplets that clue by example, as iambic hexameter lines clueing _alexandrines_, or a line with "he brung" clueing _solecism_. Very rarely, the entire verse is the clue. For example, an AE on _eclogue_ (a dialogue between shepherds) was written as an eclogue and had no final couplet.

However misleading a definition may be, it must match the word or phrase it defines in number, tense, case, and so forth. The definition for _AVERage_ can be "mean," as in "A gentle smile can mean a lot," or "Aged men, mean-spirited." But the definition can't be "means" or "meaning" or "meant." If the definition is "means," as in "A gesture means a lot," then the part-word had better be _AVERages_.

At least two letters of each part-word must start the couplet; there should be three if one letter is just a plural S or a past-tense D, and four with plural ES or past-tense ED. "Edna loved a bonny lad" is poor help for a solver looking for _ADORed_; "Espy the animals" is an equally stingy clue for _MULes_.

In some AEs, a single line or a quatrain is used for each clue instead of a couplet.

In the **double acrostical enigma**, the same puzzle legitimately leads to two different solutions. An example (and a tough one—many of the parts are uncommon):

    1. ACROSTICAL ENIGMA (3 7) (A = NI2, hyph.; 
    *B = not MW;  C = NI3, NI2 more explicit)
    2. ACROSTICAL ENIGMA (*7 5) (NI2+) (A, C = NI3+; B = NI2   phrase)

    A.	Ate a six-course dinner (cardinal sin!)
        Waiting for the noise here to begin.
    B.	Rollo croons a song the people sing;
        Flynn is playing back-up to his Bing.
    C.	Entrance planned, and grinning like a cat,
        Tina belts out western tunes with Pat.

        Troubles fade with music and a meal—
        These two can distract from what is real.
        
    =Jo the Loiterer

 

The first solution is _red_ _herring_: _RED-Hat_ (clued by "cardinal"), _ERrol_ ("Flynn"), and _RINGent_ ("grinning"). The second is _Norfolk capon_ (another term for a red herring): _NORate_ ("noise," as a verb meaning to spread a rumor), _FOLK CArol_ ("song the people sing"), and _PONent _("western").

In the **reversed acrostical enigma**, the solution is reversed before being broken into its chunks, so that the solver must put the pieces together and then reverse the whole thing to read the solution. For example, the solution _pertussis_ might be broken into the chunks _sis_, _sut_, and _rep_, and then clued in couplets as usual (with the A couplet clueing _SISter_, and so on).

The **phonetic acrostical enigma** is rarely seen in practice. There are two separate parts of the puzzle that can be phonetic: each part-word must overlap the start of the couplet phonetically and not literally; the final solution can also be a homonym of the sequence of part-word elements. For example, the part-words _CYcloid_, _KEYhole_ and _NAUGHTiness_ might be clued by "curve," "intimate," and "terrible," respectively. This would be phonetic if the first words of each part-verse were "cloyed," "wholesome," and "Enos." The part-word elements then combine, also phonetically, to give "_Psyche_ _knot_" (a hairstyle). The example below is likewise phonetic in both respects.

 
    PHONETIC ACROSTICAL ENIGMA (7 5)
        (C = NI3, two words)
     
    A.	Really banal jokes he likes to blab
        To captive hearers—riders in his cab.
    B.	Aloud I laugh a faint "ha-ha" but think,
        This guy's a jerk—a silly, worthless gink.
    C.	Geysers spout, and so does he; I view
        "Halloo" from him as cause to cringe, and do.
    D.	Scenario: this plaudit-greedy hack
        For all his rotten jokes will get the sack.
    A tremor (Richter seven) shook us good;
    He joked, "Well, folks, there goes the neighborhood!"
    =Nightowl

 

The solution: A = _GHArry_ (clued by "cab"); B = _LOSel_ (clued by "worthless gink"); C =_HEU gase_ (clued by "view halloo"); D = _MERcenary_ (clued by "greedy"); giving "gallows humor."

## Acrotelestichal enigma

Contains both an acrostical enigma and a telestichal enigma. The solution is found by reading the added letters (beginning and end) stanza by stanza.  (Purposely out of alphabetical order.)


## Altered state

A two-letter state abbreviation is replaced by another. Examples: _s-pa/ky_;  \
_prov-id/ok-e_. 


## Alternade

A word or phrase is divided into two or more others by taking alternate letters in order. Examples: _schooled_, _shoe_, _cold_; _lacerated_, _let_, _are_, _cad_. The shorter parts need not be all the same length. Another example:

 
    ALTERNADE (*7)
     
    In *ONE's the world's most famous mausoleum;
    Hawaii's where they garland you with TWOs.
    The nomads (I would rather see than be 'em)
    Of ALL remove Saharan sand from shoes.
    =Corn Cob

 

The solution: ALL = _Algeria_, *ONE = _Agra_, TWO = _lei_.

When the shorter parts are single words—as in the above example—enumeration is given only for the longest part; it's easy to deduce the lengths of the shorter parts from this.

The alternade was introduced by L'Allegro in June 1917.

Because there seem to be few good bases for alternades, this type has never been very common. However, it forms the basis for the more popular **rebus alternade**, or rebade (which see).


## Alterposal

Alternate letters are taken from a word or phrase, and then each set of letters is transposed into another word. Examples: _schooled_; _hose_ (_shoe_ transposed), _clod_ (_cold_ transposed); _lambskin_; _slim_, _bank_. The alterposal was invented by Xemu and introduced in December 1994.


## Ambigram

See anagram.


## Anagram

A word or phrase is turned into an appropriate comment or description when its letters are rearranged. Example, THEY SEE is a good anagram of _the eyes_. One-word anagram bases are not enumerated; phrases are. If a dictionary entry-phrase forms all or part of the solution, its enumeration may be [bracketed] at the editor's option. Some more examples (asterisks indicate capitalized words):

    IS TEMPO, SIRS
    =Ulk

 
    BENEATH CHOPIN (3 5 5)
    =Manx

 
    GEE, TALKER, I'M LOST! (2'1 3 *5 2 2)
    =Wabbit

 
    SNUB I USE FOR NOSY ONE ("4 2 4 8")
    =Famulus

The solutions: _prestissimo_; _the piano bench_; _it's all Greek to me_; "_none of your business_."

An anagram is usually given without any verse, the anagram itself providing the necessary clues.

An **antigram** is an anagram whose meaning is the opposite of the solution. For example, GREAT HUGE BIRD (3 10) (=Wabbit) is an antigram of _the budgerigar_ (parakeet).

Anagrams have long been used for satirical and political comment. Sometimes, then, whether a particular puzzle should be called an anagram or an antigram is a matter of opinion. Sibyl termed this sort of puzzle an **ambigram**. For example, YOUR RULES CLONE ATOMIC NIGHTMARES (=Te-Zir-Man) is an ambigram of _the Nuclear Regulatory Commission_.

A **mutation** is a rearrangement of letters that is only vaguely appropriate or even entirely irrelevant to its solution. It is always accompanied by a verse that provides the clues. Mutations are not popular, but they still appear on occasion, usually with very good or very funny verses.


## _Some guidelines for anagrams_

Good anagrams need good bases (solutions). Anagrams frequently refer to a specific event, person, or object, often currently in the news. If the base is a phrase, it should be a dictionary entry—or a proverb, title, quotation, or other familiar phrase—never just a random group of words. _Newspaper correspondents_, for example, is a fine base. _Correspondents of the newspapers_ is much less good: the phrase is seldom said that way. _Our experienced hometown newspaper correspondents_ is unacceptable, since it drags in several irrelevant words. Avoid unnecessary words: _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ivanhoe</span>, by Sir Walter Scott_ is a good base (and in fact was once anagrammed as A NOVEL BY A SCOTTISH WRITER), while _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ivanhoe</span>, the beloved historical novel by Sir Walter Scott_ is not. Unless an anagram phrase is truly familiar or easily found (in the news, for instance), it is probably unfair to solvers.

Long anagrams burden the solver with too many possibilities to consider; the shortest base on a given topic generally makes the best anagram. If an anagram is very long—say, thirty letters or more—the solver is faced with so many thousands of possibilities that the anagram must be very apposite indeed if it's to be a fair challenge. (And with that many letters to work with, the composer ought to produce perfect apposition.)

A good anagram refers clearly and directly to its base. Unacceptable examples: DEATHSMEN BE for _beheadments_ (only vaguely and indirectly related), and HI, POMPOUS PAT! for _hippopotamus_ (wholly irrelevant).

An anagram must match its base in tense, number, and person. More bad examples: DOZES ON for _snoozed_ (wrong tense), and THAT QUEER SHAKE for _the earthquakes_ (wrong number). Even if the part of speech differs, as in an adjective or adverb describing a noun base, it should be correctly inferable (as BENEATH CHOPIN for _the piano bench_).

An anagram should not include any forms of the words in its base. EDITED REVISION is a singularly pointless anagram for _revised edition_. Even the repetition of a short word like _by_ in the _Ivanhoe_ anagram above is a flaw, as is the similarity of _Scott_ and _Scottish_. The editor is the final judge of whether a flawed anagram is still fine enough to merit printing.

Every word not directly relevant to the solution is a flaw. Short "junk words" like _O_, _la_, and _ha_ are particularly common, because they are easy ways for an anagrammer to use up a few leftover letters; but they are still flaws. Eliminate them if you can: O, CONES EVICT LAVA is a flawed anagram of _active volcanoes_; but changing the base slightly to _the active volcanos_ allows CONES EVICT HOT LAVA.

The single most important thing to remember: the connection between the anagram and its base must be instantly clear when you see them together. It follows that the anagram is the most paradoxical of puzzles: the better it is, the easier it is!


## Antigram

See anagram.


## Apt flats

A phrase is given in all capitals. The solver must find another word or phrase that forms a base of the appropriate type with the given phrase and for which the phrase is an apt clue. Example: "FEAR DOTH THREATEN THEE" clues the consonantcy _Friday the thirteenth_. The "apt" modifier can apply to other base types also; for example, NOT HERE / _no, there_ is an apt heteronym; Loki-5's "HE'S A KING" is an apt letter bank (for _Genghis Khan)._
    APT CONSONANTCY 

 
    PARIS-MALE IDEOLOGY [5 3 2 6] (+)
    =Ai

The solution: _après moi le déluge_.

Note that an anagram is just an apt transposal (the type from which apt flats were generalized). Only flat types relating pairs of words that are quite different make interesting apt puzzles; an apt deletion, for example, wouldn't be much of a challenge. So in practice, only apt consonantcies and letter banks have appeared.

Apt flats were invented by Ai.


## Backswitch

A word or phrase becomes another when its last letter is changed (or "switched") and moved to the beginning, and the resulting letters are reversed ("turned back"). Examples: _autumn_, _mutual_; or _dragnet_, _en garde_.

 

In the **switchback**, a word or phrase becomes another when its first letter is changed (switched) and the remaining letters are reversed (turned back). Example: _hydra_, _tardy_.

WILLz introduced the switchback and backswitch, based on an Italian puzzle type, at the 1980 convention.


## Baltimore deletion

See deletion.


## Baltimore transdeletion

See transdeletion.


## Beheadment

A word or phrase becomes another when its first letter is removed. Examples:  \
(_f)actor_; or (_u)sable_. If the parts of the solution are all single words, the length of only the longest is given; if any part is a phrase, all parts are enumerated.

Beheadments occasionally include more than two words. A famous example is _aspirate_, _spirate_, _pirate_, _irate_, _rate_, _ate_.

In a **bigram beheadment**, a word or phrase becomes another when its first two letters are removed: (_de)livery_.

In a **phonetic beheadment**, a word or phrase becomes another when its first sound is removed. All parts are enumerated. Example: _basalt_, _assault_. For discussion of what constitutes a single sound, see phonetic flats.

In a **reversed beheadment**, after beheading the first word, reverse it to get the second. Example: _petal_, _late_.

In a **palindrome beheadment**, a word or phrase becomes another when a palindromic sequence of three or more letters is deleted from the beginning. Examples: _(Roy Or)bison_, _(viv)idly_, _(selfles)sly_. 

In a **multiple-palindrome beheadment**, a word or phrase becomes another when two or more palindrome strings are deleted sequentially from the beginning. Example: _(Iri)(sh s)(ette)r_.

In a **splitting headache**, the solution is split into two parts, each of which is beheaded to form a new word. Examples: _anagram_; _nag_, _am_ and _hearthstone_; _earth_, _tone_. 


## Bigram puzzles

Instead of single letters, bigrams (two-letter groups) are the basic units of these puzzles. An example is the bigram reversal ONE = _se-ra-ph_, TWO = _ph-ra-se_. A bigram deletion: _impet(uo)us_. For more information, look up the next word in the puzzle's name.


## Brevigram

A word that appears in an answer word or phrase is replaced by its abbreviation, creating the other answer word or phrase. Examples: _Southend_, _send_; _feasted_, _feed_.


## Brookline letter change

See letter change.


## Change of heart

Two words or phrases are each divided into three pieces; then their middle pieces are switched to form two others. Example: ONE = _share_, TWO = _colt_, THREE = _sole_, FOUR = _chart_. (This would appear in the solution list as "s(har)e, c(ol)t.) Another example: ONE = _wine steward_, TWO = _FDR_, THREE = _windward_, FOUR = _fester_ ("win(e ste)ward, F(D)R").

A change of heart is similar to a double-cross, except that the pieces that are switched come from the middles of the ONE and TWO rather than the ends. Note that as in a double-cross, ONE and THREE have the same beginnings, as do TWO and FOUR. (See also the heart transplant.)

The change of heart was invented by Lunch Boy and named by Xemu.


## Changeover

A word or phrase becomes another when one letter changes to another and moves to another location. The changeover is labeled by the starting and finishing locations. Example of a first-to-third changeover: _holster_, _oldster_.
    SECOND-TO-SEVENTH CHANGEOVER (8)
    Grampaw says that he alone
    Brought in Billy the Kid.
    (Gramps was a ONE who TWO his flock—
    That's all he really did.)
    =Mr. Tex

The solution: _goatherd_, _gathered_.

In a **reversed changeover**, one letter changes to another and moves to another location, and then the result is reversed. Example: _retain_, _natter_.

The changeover was invented by Quiz, named by Merlin, and introduced in June 1992.


## Charade

A word or phrase is divided into two or more shorter ones. Example: _scar-city_. The spelling of each part remains the same, though pronunciation may change, as in: TOTAL = _outreached_; ONE = _outré_, TWO = _ached_.
    CHARADE (*8)
    A box of fudge, some gingersnaps
    (Or other tasty ONE), a gay
    Corsage (an orchid—WHOLE, perhaps)
    Might well have won her—yesterday.
    But in this modern TWO, old ways
    Of wooing leave her bored and cold.
    You need a gimmick nowadays—
    Though diamond rings still work, I'm told.
    =Windjammer and Uncanny

The solution: WHOLE = _Goodyera_, ONE = _goody_, TWO = _era_. Notice that only the enumeration of the longest word or phrase (WHOLE) is given. The solver has to figure out the lengths of the shorter parts. However, it is noted if any shorter part is capitalized, hyphenated, or a phrase.

In a **phonetic charade**, the pronunciation of each part remains the same, though spelling may change, as in _haystacks_; _haste_, _axe_. Again, only the length of the longest word or phrase (TOTAL) is given.

In a **reversed charade**, the parts are assembled and then reversed to produce the whole word or phrase. Example: ONE = _red_, TWO = _rum_, TOTAL = _murder_.

In an **addition charade**, a letter is deleted from each shorter word or phrase, and the results combined into the long word or phrase. Only the enumeration of the long word or phrase is given. Examples: _taped_; _ta(m)p_, _e(n)d_ and _reindeer_; _re(m)ind_,  \
_e(v)er_. Invented by LeXman and introduced in April 2010.

In a **deletion charade**, a letter (not necessarily the same one) is added to each part word, and the results combined into the long word or phrase. Example: _blackened_; _back_, _end_.

In a **beheadment charade**, the initial letters of the smaller words are removed, and the remaining letters are combined as in a charade. Only the enumeration of the long word is given. Example: ONE = _echo_, TWO = _nice_, WHOLE = _choice_.

In a **curtailment charade**, the final letters of the smaller words are removed, and the remaining letters are combined as in a charade. Example: ONE = _cream_, TWO = _ten_, WHOLE = _create_.

In a **transposal charade**, two or more smaller solution words are transposed and then combined into the long solution word. Example: ONE = _teen_, TWO = _fire_, WHOLE = _Tenerife_.

In a **phrase charade**, a phrase (not necessarily MW) is separated at word breaks in different ways to create phrases with different meanings. Example: _fed up with_; _fed up, with_; _fed, up with_.

In a **transdeletion charade**, delete a letter from each smaller word or phrase, anagram each result, and then concatenate them to make the longer word or phrase. Example: _iconic_, _nation_, _Cincinnati_.

In a **partially phonetic charade**, one of the parts is alphabetic and the other is phonetic. Example: _cyclone_; _psych_, _lone_.

In a **palindrome deletion charade**, a palindrome is deleted from each of the initial words or phrases and the results combined into the final word or phrase. Example: _gu(ardra)il_ + (_no on)e_ = _guile_.

In a **reversed palindrome deletion charade**, a palindrome is deleted from each of the initial words or phrases. The remaining letters are brought together and reversed to form a new word or phrase. Example: _m(oto)r_, _a(gog)_, _arm_.


## Combination padlock

See padlock.


## Consonantcy

Two or more words or phrases share the same consonants in the same order, with any number of vowels. Y is treated as a vowel. Example: _acorn_, _crayon_, _ocarina_.
    CONSONANTCY (5, 7, 7)
    Each time I play a polka, all the girls pelt me with peonies.
    I start a samba—snowdrops, if you please!
    Before I've run a rumba through, it rains down rhododendrons,
    And when I ONE the TWO they throw me THREEs.
    =Trazom

The solution: ONE = _begin_, TWO = _beguine_, THREE = _begonia_.

The consonantcy was invented by Newrow in 1991.

In a **reversed consonantcy**, the consonants of the second word or phrase are reversed with respect to the consonants in the first word or phrase. Example: _syzygy_, _gazes_.

In a **consonantcy deletion**, consonants are deleted one by one from a starting word, and the basewords are consonantcies of the result. Examples: _consonant_,  \
_consent_; _amounting_, _untongue_, _Antigua_. The consonantcy deletion was invented by Newrow. 

A **consonantcy word deletion** works like a word deletion, except that only consonants are considered. That is, the inner word to be deleted is a consonantcy for some central section of the main base word; the remaining consonants are used in the outer word. Examples: _quartz_; _rote_, _quiz_ and _situation comedy_, _tonic_, _esteemed_. It was invented by Newrow. 

In a **consonantcy palindrome deletion**, delete a palindromic set of three or more consonants. Example: _Matterhorn_, _mutation_ (delete rhr). 


## Convergence

A word or phrase is divided into a series of shorter words or phrases by taking letters in order from the original word—one from the front, then one from the back, then one from the front, and so on. Enumerations for the shorter words are not given. Examples: _sapwort_ → _star_, _pow_; or _zuppa inglese_ → _Zeus_, _pepla_, _gin_. The convergence was invented by Lunch Boy. 


## Cryptogram key

Each pair of letters in the "key" indicates a (possibly repeated) letter change. These changes encrypt the first partword into the second. Each pair in the key must be used; any additional letters in the partwords are left unchanged. Example: _oils_; _lolly_, _sissy_. The key "oils" indicates o → i and l → s, changing "lolly" to "sissy."

A **phonetic cryptogram key** works like a cryptogram key except that it uses phonemes rather than letters. 


## Curtailment

A word or phrase becomes another when its last letter is removed. Example:  \
_sting(y)_.
    CURTAILMENT (8)
    I'm a young LONGER chemist, but so far I've failed
    To discover a drug that's as good as CURTAILED.
    My motives are pure: to make the world healthy
    And in the process become really wealthy!
    =Mr. Tex

The solution: LONGER = _aspiring_, FINAL = _aspirin_.

A curtailment may consist of more than two words, though these are rare. An obscure but dazzling example: ONE = _chorizont_ (one who ascribes the_ Iliad_ and the_ Odyssey_ to different authors—look it up in NI2 if you don't believe it!), TWO =  \
_C-horizon_ (a particular layer of soil), THREE = _chorizo_ (a kind of spicy sausage).

In a **bigram curtailment**, a word or phrase becomes another when its last two letters are removed. Example, ONE = _satiety_, TWO = _Satie_.

In a **phonetic curtailment**, a word or phrase becomes another when its last sound is removed. Example: _qt_ (as in "on the qt"), _cute_, _queue_. For discussion of what constitutes a single sound, see phonetic flats.

In a **reversed curtailment**, after curtailing the first word or phrase, you reverse it to get the second. Example: _stinky_, _knits_.

In a **palindrome curtailment**, a word or phrase becomes another when a palindromic sequence of three or more letters is deleted from the end. Examples: _a(cidic)_ and _mart(ini)_. 

In a **bigram palindrome curtailment**, a sequence of three or more bigrams that make a palindrome is deleted from the end of a word, leaving another word. Examples: _the(re)(fo)(re)_ and _c(it)(ru)(s f)(ru)(it)_. 


## Cyclegram

Each word in the base consists of two parts. The first part is identical to the second part of the preceding word; the second part is identical to the first part of the following word. The chain wraps around: the second part of the last word is identical to the first part of the first word. For a three-word base, the pattern is AB, BC, CA. Examples: _mica_, _case_, _semi_ and _ingle_, _legroom_, _grooming_.

The cyclegram was invented by Badir and introduced in October 2007.  


## Deletion

A word or phrase becomes another when an interior letter is removed. Example: _simile_, _smile_.
    DELETION (*7, 4-2)
    We found a TWO for shelter from the sun—
    So unrelenting was the summer heat—
    And looked out at the sparkling Gulf of ONE,
    Where long ago the Turks had met defeat.
    =Mangie

The solution: ONE = _Lepanto_, TWO = _lean-to_.

A deletion may include more than two words. A famous old example: NINE = _startling_, EIGHT = _starling_, SEVEN = _staring_, SIX = _string_, FIVE = _sting_, FOUR = _sing_. (Do you want to go on to THREE = _sin_ and TWO = _in_? In NPL terms, those are not deletions but one curtailment and one beheadment. You could still use all eight words in one puzzle, but you'd have to warn the solver that two—unspecified— steps were a curtailment and beheadment, not deletions.)

In the rarely seen **Baltimore deletion**, each letter in turn is removed to form a new word. Example, TOTAL = _peat_, ONE = _eat_, TWO = _pat_, THREE = _pet_, FOUR = _pea_.

In a **bigram deletion**, a word or phrase becomes another when two consecutive interior letters are removed. Example, _ca(te)nary_.

In a **repeated-letter deletion**, a word or phrase becomes another when one letter is removed wherever it occurs. Example: _ba(ss)i(s)t_; and ONE = _prospered_, TWO = _rose-red_ ("(p)ros(p)ered" in the solutions). In a **multiple repeated-letter deletion**, all repeated letters are deleted. Example: _catacomb_, _tomb_.

In a **reversed deletion**, after you've deleted a letter from the first word or phrase, you reverse it to get the second. Example: ONE = _espalier_, TWO = _relapse_. (This would appear as "espal(i)er.")

All sorts of combinations of these elements are possible. An example of a **repeated-bigram deletion**: ONE = _derrières_, TWO = _dries_. This would appear as "d(er)ri(èr)es." A **repeated-trigram deletion**: ONE = _card-carrying_, TWO = _drying_. This would appear as "(car)d-(car)rying." A **repeated-tetragram deletion**: ONE = _George Orwell_, TWO = _well_. This would appear as "(Geor)(ge Or)well."

In a **phonetic deletion**, a word or phrase becomes another when an interior sound is removed. Example: _revelry_, _reveille._ For discussion of what constitutes a single sound, see phonetic flats.

In a **palindrome deletion**, a word or phrase becomes another when an interior  palindromic sequence of three or more letters is deleted. Examples: pes(simis)t;  \
s(taccat)o and or(igi)nate. The palindrome deletion was invented by Newrow and introduced in October 2004.

In a **multiple-palindrome deletion**, a word or phrase becomes another when two or more palindrome strings are deleted from different locations, with no indication of a beheadment or curtailment. Examples: _(fif)th es(tat)e_ and _di(visiv)(ene)ss_. 

In a **successive-palindrome deletion**, a sequence of three or more letters that make a palindrome is deleted from the original answer, and then a further palindrome is deleted from the result to give the second answer. Example: _[T(oro)nt]o_. 

In a **mirror trigram deletion**, a word or phrase becomes another when two trigrams, one a reversal of the other, are deleted. Example: _p(rot)ec(tor)s_.

In a **synonym deletion**, a synonym of the main base word has letters which are a subset of the letters in the main word. Remove those letters, and what remains, in that order, spells a second word. The synonym might be a synonym for a sense of the main word other than the one used in the flat. Examples: _separate_; _see_, _apart_ [synonym] and _against_; _gas_, _anti_ [synonym]. The synonym deletion was invented by Endgame. 


## Diastichal enigma

The diastichal enigma (DE) is a variant of the acrostical enigma. Each part-word in a DE is clued by a couplet, and the answer word overlaps the break between the couplet's two lines, using at least one letter from one line and two from the other. As in an AE, the pieces from the part-words not taken from the verse are strung together to form the answer:
    DIASTICHAL ENIGMA (6)
    A.	My love life's in pieces!  I just can't decide:
    Stay with my boyfriend or let it all slide?
    B.	He acts like a sleazy and cheap gigolo.
    Right now, he can stay, but soon he may go!
    He thinks our relationship's only a game.
    I feel our connection's still there all the same.
    =Dart

The solution: _deBRIs_ ("pieces"), _loDGEr_ ("he can stay"); _BRIDGE_ ("game," "connection").

The diastichal enigma was invented by Beo and first appeared in December 2001.


## Double acrostical enigma

See acrostical enigma.


## Double-cross

Two words or phrases are each divided into two pieces; then their second pieces are switched to form two others. Example: _maids_, _rapture_, _mature_, _rapids_. (This would appear in the solutions list as "ma/ids, rap/ture.")

 
    DOUBLE-CROSS (8, 5, 4, *9) (*9 = NI2)
     
    With a slim, steely ONE,
    The foul deed was done;
    The client was given the sack.
    From offstage, a noble
    Sang "Woman is mobile."
    So—who could FOUR have on his back?
     
    A dread hunch had he
    When he felt the sack THREE:
    Of what burden was he the carrier?
    Gilda set up a din
    (TWO had not yet set in)
    And bade FOUR farewell with an aria.
    =Pen Gwyn

 

The solution: ONE = _stiletto_, TWO = _rigor_, THREE = _stir_, FOUR = _Rigoletto_. (This would appear as "sti/letto, rigo/r.")

The enumeration of all four parts of a double-cross is given.

When composing or solving a double-cross, be careful not to mix up THREE and FOUR: note that ONE and THREE have the same beginning, as do TWO and FOUR.

In a **phonetic double-cross**, the parts are rearranged phonetically and not by spelling. For example: _Hall of Fame_, _gurneys_, _Holofernes_, _game_.

In a **reversed double-cross**, after switching the second pieces of ONE and TWO, you reverse the results to get THREE and FOUR. Example: _red rover_, _Erebus_, _suborder_, _revere_. (This would appear as "red ro/ver, Ere/bus.")

Based on an idea by Stilicho, the double-cross was introduced by Nightowl at the 1980 convention.


## Dropout

Two words (THREE and FOUR) are joined; then one word (ONE) is dropped out to form another (TWO) from the leftover letters. Example: THREE = _reamer_, FOUR = _itch_, ONE = _merit_, TWO = _reach_. (This would appear as "rea(mer it)ch.") Another example: envi(ron, delet)ed.

The enumeration of all four parts must be given.

In a **progressive dropout**, three or more words or phrases are nested (ONE always innermost) to form two others. Example: ONE = _ach_, TWO = _aviator_, THREE = _latrine_, FOUR = _La Traviata_, FIVE = _chorine_. (This would appear as  \
"La Tr[aviat(a, ch)or]ine.")

The dropout, introduced by Nightowl in 1984, is actually identical to one type of the progressive padlock. But the progressive dropout is unique.


## Enigma

A word or phrase is clued indirectly through wordplay.
    ENIGMA (*6 5)
    In the city I run, up north quite a ways,    If you take the gold, you'll get thirty days.    You can call me Your Honor, but I'll warn you, son—
    If you take my gold, you'll get thirty-one.
    =Atlantic

The solution: _Juneau mayor_. (If you take the AU from _Juneau_—Au being the chemical symbol for gold—you'll get _June_. If you take _or_—the heraldic term for gold—from _mayor_, you'll get _May_.)

Like most flat bases, enigma answers should be dictionary entries. "Juneau mayor" is not an entry: now and then a puzzle that breaks a rule is so clever, with a verse so lively and well clued, that the editor finds it irresistible. But not often.

There is no hard and fast distinction between an enigma and a riddle (which see). Generally, a riddle describes a thing and an enigma a word; riddles have deceptive descriptions, enigmas some form of wordplay. An occasional flat can fairly be classified as either.


## Enigmatic rebus

See rebus.


## Even exchange

Two words or phrases exchange all their letters in even positions to form two new words. Examples: _fare_, _cost_ → _fort_, _case_ and _gorges_, _cannot_ → _garnet_, _Congo's_. It was invented by Dandr and introduced in January 2001. 


## False derivative

A word or phrase becomes another when some grammatical change is inappropriately applied. For example, a false plural: _inter_, _interim_ (analogy with the plurals _seraphim_ and _cherubim_).

 
    FALSE FEMININE (6, 8)
     
    To FINAL her ego, he made up his mind
    To PRIMAL her up—ah, a clever man, he.
    For flattery gets you, not nowhere, you'll find,
    But right to the place you're most eager to be.
    =Polly and Mangie

 

The solution: PRIMAL = _butter_, FINAL = _buttress_ (analogous to _waiter_ and _waitress_.)

Some other examples will show you how many possibilities there are. The **false antecedent**: _sent_, _present_; or _sting_, _foresting_. The **false comparative**: _limb_, _limber_. The **false gerund**: _shill_, _shilling_. The **false negative**: _plus_, _nonplus_; or _gone_, _Antigone_. The **false past tense**: _worst_, _worsted_; or _live_, _lave_ (analogy with _give_ and _gave_). The **false reiterative**: _treat_, _retreat_.

False flats based on very obscure derivations, or even on pairs of words that are not derivationally related, are fairly common. In such cases, to be fair to solvers, the model should appear in the verse, or at least be very clearly clued. For example, the **false plural**: _shader_, _Shadrach (_"knaidel" appeared in the verse; its plural is "knaidlach"). Or the f**alse opposite**: _census, SASEs (_based on the opposition "centum/satem," explained in 11C; the word "centum" appeared in the verse, as did an explanation of the opposition.)


## Flats we never finished reading (FWNFR)

Sometimes a flat is solvable after reading just the first line or two. Flats we never finished reading present only that first line or two. These shortened flats must be solvable based on only the information given, which often doesn't include cuewords. This means that the clueing presented in the shortened verse  must be complete.

FWNFR should not be used just as a way to present bases that the composer didn't feel inspired to versify. "Flats we never finished writing" are often uninteresting, and are likely to be underclued. FWNFR tend to work best with simpler bases, but the existence of FWNFR as a type should not discourage composers from writing full flats on those bases.

FWNFR were introduced by Xemu.

 
    LAST-LETTER CHANGE (7)
     
    The ugly crook was on the lam . . . 
    =Shrdlu

 

The solution: _hideous, hideout_

 
    METATHESIS (5)
     
    As a Pueblo, my home . . .
    =Mobot 

 

The solution: _adobe, abode_.


## Freewheeling

A flat with a base that not only has a phrase that is not in the dictionary, but that does not, should not, and will not appear in any theoretical dictionary ever. A freewheeling letter shift would be ONE = blustering, TWO = blue string. Freewheeling bases were once exclusively used in Ralves (but not marked "freewheeling" to hide their Ralfish nature), but it was then argued that freewheeling bases often weren't Ralfish enough, and they began appearing (very) occasionally in the Enigma. Freewheeling bases should not vary too much from MW words and phrases, since the idea can be taken too far. It is unlikely that a freewheeling well-mixed transposal would ever be printed, for example. The term "freewheeling" was coined by Crax.

    FREEWHEELING PHONETIC DELETION
        (*3 *10, 7 1 5) (OPERA TUNE = not MW) 
    Here's a tip you should remember:
    Try New York in late November.
    Post-Thanksgiving, you can get
    OPERA TUNE seats at the Met.
    Then see Disney's huge balloon,
    As Macy's workers OPPORTUNE. 
    = Mr. Tex 

The solution: OPERA TUNE = _Die Fledermaus_, OPPORTUNE = _deflate a mouse_. 

 


## Group flats

Each of the answer words or phrases is related to a member of a well-known group in the manner of a specified flat type. The original example in January 1995 by ΧΕΙΡΩΝ is a **transaddition group** (6, 5, 6, 6): _kobold_, _pilot_, _ersatz_, _swathe_, based on _blood_, _toil_, _tears_, _sweat_ (from the Churchill speech). _Kobold_ is a "transaddition," a transposal with a letter added, of _blood_; _pilot_ is a transaddition of _toil_; and so on.

Tagging for group members need not be as detailed as for the answers (for example, "some group members are not MW usage"). If the group members normally occur in a specific order, as in the example above, the answers should preferably follow that order.

Other possibilities include the **transdeletion group** (_shot_, _troops_, _Masai_: transdeletions of _Athos_, _Porthos_, and _Aramis_, the Three Musketeers), the **consonantcy group** (_forest_, _ascend_, _thread_, _frothy_: consonantcies of _first_, _second_, _third_, and _fourth_), and the **reversed consonantcy group** (_dory_, _thaw_, _alibi_: reversed consonantcies of _red_, _white_, and _blue_). The **homonym group** already exists under the name homoconcominym.

You needn't include the group words on your solution list (in the example above, you need send only "kobold, pilot, ersatz, swathe"); in fact, it's possible to solve all the parts of a group flat without ever realizing what the group is.

Some composers add veiled clues to the group (for example, a flat built on _Curly_, _Larry_, and _Moe_ might include the word _stooges_); this is not required, and in some cases would make the flats too easy.


## Head-to-tail shift

A word or phrase becomes another when its first letter is moved to its end. Examples: _emanate_, _manatee_; _brand_, _R and B_; and _holds out_, _Old South_.

In a **head-to-tail sound shift**, a word or phrase becomes another when its first sound is moved to its end. Example: _ciao_, _ouch_.

In a **reversed head-to-tail shift**, a word or phrase becomes another when its first letter is moved to its end, and then the whole is reversed. Example: _flatcar_, _fractal_.


## Heart transplant

In a heart transplant, a letter or series of letters is taken from inside one word and transplanted to another. Example: ONE = _clear_, TWO = _wild_, THREE = _car_, FOUR = _willed_ (transplanting the LE). (This would appear in the solution list as "c(le)ar,  \
wil-d.") Another example:  _ger(ry)mander_, _car-away_.

The heart transplant was invented by Xemu and introduced in June 1997.


## Heteronym

Two words or phrases with the same spelling are used with different pronunciations and meanings. Examples: _tarry_ ("to linger"), _tarry_ ("covered with tar"); _Mount St. Helens_, _mounts the lens_; _mustache_, _must ache_. Unlike most flats, heteronyms need not have bases that are dictionary entries—in fact, long, contrived phrases are welcome as long as they are well clued in the verse.

"Heteronymic" also refers to changes in word breaks, even if pronunciation doesn't change:  _cargo/ car go. _Examples may be found in cryptic clueing, picture puzzles, and the heteronymy of a rebus's reading and answer. A base in which sounds, letters, and spacing remain unchanged, as in _bear_ (carry), _bear _(ursine), and _Bear _(CA river), is called an **identity homonym**, and should be avoided.


## Homoantonym

Two words or phrases sound like two other words or phrases that are antonyms. Examples: _knights_, _daze_; or _plane_, _fan see_. Unlike most flats, homoantonyms need not have bases that are dictionary entries.

Enumerations are given for both parts of the solution (though not for the antonyms they sound like).

Both parts of a homoantonym must be spelled differently from the antonyms they sound like. The antonyms are tagged if necessary, even though they don't themselves appear in the puzzle.

The homoantonym was introduced by Quefanon in September 1938.


## Homoconcominym

Two words or phrases sound like two other words or phrases that form a familiar pair. Examples: _hied_, _hare_ ("neither hide nor hair"); or _hart_, _sole_ ("heart and soul"). Unlike most flats, homoconcominyms need not have bases that are dictionary entries.


## Homonym

Two or more unrelated words or phrases are pronounced the same but spelled differently. Example: _hair_, _hare_. Unlike most flats, homonyms need not have bases that are dictionary entries. Example: _we pause_, _wee paws_.

A **mynomoh** is a reversed homonym; the phonemes of one solution provide the second solution when read in reverse order. Example: _lutetium_, _mushy tool_. 


## Homosynonym

Two words or phrases sound like two other words that are synonyms. Example: _rose_, _tears_ (which sound like "rows" and "tiers"). Unlike most flats, homosynonyms need not have bases that are dictionary entries.

 
    HOMOSYNONYM (4, 4)
     
    For a TWO, at the bank I applied.
    My papers they checked (eagle-eyed).
    "Collateral? None,
    Except for my ONE."
    "Oh, go to the devil!" they cried.
    =Sal

 

The solution: ONE = _soul_, TWO = _loan_ (sole and lone).

Enumerations are given for both parts of the solution (though not for the synonyms they sound like).

Both parts of a homosynonym must be spelled differently from the synonyms they sound like. The synonyms should be tagged if necessary, even though they don't themselves appear in the puzzle.


## Interlock

Two or more words or phrases are interlocked to form a longer one; unlike the alternade, the parts aren't combined in a regular pattern. Example: ONE = _fig_, TWO = _rebus_, WHOLE = _firebugs_. The part whose first letter appears first in the longer word (_fig_ in the example) is called ONE, and the other parts are numbered in the order their first letters appear.

    INTERLOCK (8)
    ONE, gee whiz!
    A nasty night it is.
    Rain pelts down.
    The tavern's two blocks down.
    Shucks, why not?
    Some TWO would hit the spot.
    Muddy street.
    I'll put on my COMPLETE.
    =Corn Cob

 

The solution: COMPLETE = _galoshes_, ONE = _gosh_, TWO = _ales_.

All words in an interlock must in fact interlock. None may appear unbroken, as _urn_ does in ONE = _tome_, TWO = _urn_, THREE = _ant_, WHOLE = _tournament_; this is not an acceptable base.

In a **reversed interlock**, after interlocking the parts, you reverse the result. The parts are numbered in the order that their first letters appear in the unreversed result. Example: ONE = _late_, TWO = _circle_, ALL = _electrical_.

Even with easy words in the base, the interlock can be difficult to solve because the letters can be ordered in so many ways. In kindness to solvers, composers should be sure interlock parts are especially well clued.

The interlock was proposed as early as June 1945, but it caught on when Brutus introduced it in April 1977.


## Isomorph

All words have the same cryptogram pattern, so that if they were encrypted it would be impossible to tell them apart. Examples: _fulfil_, _Ionian_; _usually_, _fifteen_; and _actually_, _thirteen_.

The isomorph was invented by Treesong. 


## Italian-style

Has no cuewords. Instead, each stanza provides clues, more or less obliquely, to one solutions word or phrase. Italian-style flats also have a secondary title that refers to the overall subject that makes the puzzle appear to hang together (but which, of course, is another layer of subterfuge that the solver must try to see through). Hot introduced Italian-style puzzles, and the following example was written for the article that introduced these flats and picture flats to the modern NPL in the August 1999 issue of The Enigma.

    ITALIAN-STYLE REVERSED DELETION (*6, 5) (*6 = RH2) 
            To a Young Boxer 
    When training, you must choose a coach --
     A famous name will help a bunch.
     A bell will sound; you'll see approach
     A man. What does he bring? A punch! 
    If then you find you're laid out flat,
     Just rise again. It's true, I see,
     You weren't that good, but what of that?
     Now you can sting just like a bee! 
    = Lunch Boy 

The solution: _Amtrak_, _karma_. 


## Letter bank

A word or phrase (the "bank") is chosen that has no repeated letters. One or more longer words or phrases are formed, each using all the letters in the bank at least once and as many more times as needed. At least one word must be three or more letters longer than the bank. Examples: _lens_, _senselessness_; and _law_, _Walla Walla_. The bank can produce a number of longer words or phrases. Examples: _larch pines_, _pencil sharpener_, _Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin_; and _manicures_, _Neiman Marcus_, _American sumac_, _marine insurance_.

Not surprisingly, it's harder to make long words and phrases from a bank than short ones. For example, you can make several six-letter words from _field_, including _fiddle_, _filled_, and _defile_, but only one twelve-letter word, _fiddledeedee_, and no longer words at all. The longer words produce a more interesting puzzle; as long as you have one word that's three (or more) letters longer, it's all right to add very well clued shorter ones.

The letter bank was invented by WILLz, who introduced it at the 1980 convention.

In a **letter bank with interest**, some or all of the long words are paired with "interest" words made from the "excesses," over the bank, of the longer words. Example: _stale_; _Seattle_, _ET_; _tasteless_, _sets_; _lattes_, _T_. The bank is "stale"; the long word "Seattle" is paired with "ET", since those are its letters minus the bank; the long word "tasteless" is paired with "sets"; and the long word "lattes" is paired with "T." Another example: _magnet_; _magnate_, _a_; _management_, _mean_. 

In a **bank loan**, one word, the "bank," has no repeated letters. The remaining word(s) contain any or all of those letters, as frequently as needed, but no others; they may thus be longer or shorter than the "bank" word. All words put together in enumeration order form a phrase of strong dictionary nature, which is not clued as part of the solution but may or may not be clued tangentially. Thus the entire solution is a letter-bank phrase that banks to part of itself. If the "bank" word is not the longest of the solution words, that fact will be made clear by the enumeration, cuewords, or tagging. Examples: _split_, _personality_ and _signature_, _tune_. 

A **letter bankless** is a letter bank where the minimal set of letters is not included in the base. This is most likely to be done because the minimal set will not transpose into a word. For example, _princelet_, _Peter Principle_. The letter bankless was invented by ΧΕΙΡΩΝ.

In an **apt letter bankless**, the unique letters in a phrase are the bank for the solution. Example: "that ol' Camille Saint-Saens favorite" → _The Carnival of the Animals_.

An **inapt letter bank** leads to an answer that implies the opposite of the bank itself. Examples: "Cuts! Lower pay!" → _Occupy Wall Street_; _is not café_, _instant coffee_. 


## Letter change

A specified letter is changed to make a new word or phrase. Example (a third-letter change): _pastry_, _pantry_.

    FIRST-LETTER CHANGE (6)
    B we'll get some rain today
    Or all my garden flowers will A.
    =Brillig

The solution: A = _wither_, B = _either_. (The solution would appear as "w/e-ither.")

Letter changes can have more than two parts. Example: _boast_, _beast_, _blast_.

If the last letter is being changed, the flat is called a **last-letter change**. Example: _molts_, _molto_ is called a last-letter, instead of a fifth-letter, change.

In a **reversed letter change**, a letter is changed in a word or phrase and the result is then reversed to make another. Example (reversed second-letter change):  \
_twanger_, _regnant_.

In a **terminal-letter change**, the first and last letters of a word are changed to different letters. Examples: _Spider-man_, _epidermal_ and _grimace_, _primacy_. 

In a **palindrome-to-letter change**, a group of three or more letters that form a palindrome are replaced by a single letter to form a second word or phrase. Examples: C(ana)da, c(o)da and Can(ada), can(e). 

In the **Brookline letter change**, a word or phrase changes each one of its letters in turn to make others. Example: BASE = _rice_, ONE = _nice_, TWO = _race_, THREE = _rile_, FOUR = _rich_.

    BROOKLINE LETTER CHANGE (5)
    He C not to BASEWORD the girls any more;
    That A of his life was now over, he swore.
    But looking? To B that would leave a great E.
    The very idea could make a man D.
    =Mangie

 

The solution: BASEWORD = _chase_, A = _phase_, B = _cease_, C = _chose_, D = _chafe_, E = _chasm_.

The Brookline letter change was introduced by Newrow (from Brookline MA) in 1991.

In a **Redmond letter change**, change each letter of a word in order, forming a new word at each step. Example: risk, disk, desk, deck, deco.

See also repeated-letter change.


## Letter shift

A word or phrase becomes another when one letter is shifted to a new position. Examples: _trollop_, _roll top_ and _Proust_, _sprout_.

If the letter is shifted only one space (as in _complaint_ to _compliant_), the puzzle is traditionally classified as a metathesis (which see) instead.

If the letter is shifted from the beginning to the end of the word, the puzzle is a special type of letter shift called a head-to-tail shift.

In a **reversed letter shift**, a word or phrase becomes another when one letter is shifted to a new position and the result is reversed. Example: _ignited_, _dieting_.

In a **successive letter shift**, one letter in the first word or phrase is shifted to a different position to create a new word or phrase, than a (usually different) letter in the second word or phrase is shifted to generate the third result. Example: _Scantron_, _Scranton_, _Cranston_. 

In a **sound shift**, a word or phrase becomes another when one sound is shifted to a new position. Example: _umber_, _bummer_.

A **word shift** works the same as a phrase shift, except that the original is a single word rather than a phrase. (Basically it's a freewheeling letter shift with the first word missing, but implied.) Example: _moron stuck_ [moonstruck]. 


## Linkade

A word or phrase is broken into two or more shorter parts, which overlap by  one letter. Examples: _philately_; _Phil_, _lately_ and _libraries_; _Libra_, _Aries_.


## Literatim

The individual letters in a word or phrase are numbered consecutively, and other words or phrases are composed by pronouncing the letters individually or in combinations. Example: TOTAL = _vacations_, 9-4 = _essay_ (S-A), 6-1 = _ivy_ (I-V), 2-5 = _eighty_ (A-T), 8-1 = _envy_ (N-V), 6-3 = _icy_ (I-C), 7 = _owe_ (O). The cuewords are the strings of numbers, and the verse rhymes and scans with the numbers read out in full, as illustrated here:

    LITERATIM (6)
    The giddy couple sit and drink down by the River *4
    Until his speech has blurred a bit; her vision, even more.
    "6, bless my soul, it's 3 5!" "2?" he mutters, like a snore.
    "Well, naught care I if 3 1—both will fancy what's in store."
    Their conversation starts and stops; some WORD and then a snort;
    She urges him to WORD; alas, the tipsy deed is short.
    "Oh, aye, 'tis truth that whisky makes the inhibitions sleep,
    But what's the use if so does he, and makes a poor girl weep?"
    =Sibyl

The solution: _bawdry_ (*4 = _Dee_, 6 = _why_, 3 5 = _double you are_, 2 = _eh_, 3 1 = _double you be_).

Each letter in TOTAL must be used in at least one shorter part, and it may be used in more than one. Parts like 6-6 for _aye-aye_ (from the solution _vacations_) that use a number more than once are allowable. The whole solution must be an MW word or phrase, but the parts may be non-MW phrases.


## Lock and drop

See PADLOCK.


## Metathesis

A word or phrase becomes another when two letters are interchanged. Examples: _converse_, _conserve_ and _fine arts_, _fire ants_.

In a **reversed metathesis**, a word or phrase becomes another when two letters are interchanged and the result is reversed. Example: _oompahs_, _shampoo_.


## Mutation

See anagram.


## Mutual replacement

Two letters replace each other whenever they appear. Examples: _sell_, _less_ and  \
_travail_, _trivial_. 


## Mynomoh

See HOMONYM.


## Mynoreteh

A reversed heteronym. A word or phrase becomes another when reversed. Examples: _won ton_, _not now_; or ONE = _barcarole's summer—aha!_, TWO = _a harem, mussel, or a crab_.

Unlike most flat types, a mynoreteh needn't have only dictionary entries; indeed, at least one part must be non-MW—otherwise the puzzle would be called a reversal (which see) instead.

The mynoreteh was introduced by Ulk in 1990.


## Name change

See WORD SUBSTITUTION.


## Omnistichal enigma

Each couplet clues three partwords, sequentially: one acrostical, one diastichal, and one telestichal. In order, these partwords give the solution. Example: _INCipit_,  \
_cOMPact_, _antRE_, _HENce_, _senSIBle_, _cantLE_. (aka **interstichal enigma**) 


## Order takeout 

From a longer word, every sequence of two or more adjacent letters in consecutive alphabetical order is removed to form a shorter word. Example: _defenders_, _en_. In a **redro takeout**, sequences in reverse alphabetical order are removed. Examples: _debuted_, _deb_; _opponents_, _open_; and _postponing_, _sting_.


## Overloaded flats

Overloaded flats are puzzles in which a cueword can stand for any of two or more solution words.

    OVERLOADED THIRD-LETTER CHANGE (2 4, 4-2)
    It's time to start the bacchanal;
    Everyone disrobes. I count
    Eleven folks (an odd amount)
    Who'll cause the bed to rock, in all.
    I'm feeling just a little shy,
    So I check out the dinner spread.
    It's just some veggies on a bed
    Of stir-fried noodles, which I try—
    It stinks! But it's the only food,
    So I fill up a plate and wander
    Back to the bedroom, where I ponder
    What to do. It might be rude
    To cut in on a busy pair,
    And everyone seems occupied . . . 
    Back to the kitchen. I must confide,
    I'm not enjoying this AFFAIR.
    =Lunch Boy

The solution: _lo mein_, _love-in_.


## Padlock

The last one or more letters of a word or phrase (LEFT) are the same as the first one or more letters of another (RIGHT); joining the remaining letters forms another (LOCK). Examples: LEFT = _norther_, RIGHT = _thermal_, LOCK = _normal_; and LEFT = _après-ski_, RIGHT = _press kit_, LOCK = _at_.

Notice that every letter must be used in exactly two words or phrases.

The **combination padlock** is the same as the padlock, with the added feature that overlapping LEFT and RIGHT produces a fourth word or phrase (WHOLE). For example: LEFT = _scar_, RIGHT = _Arab_, LOCK = _scab_, WHOLE = _scarab_.

In the **progressive padlock**, three or more words or phrases form an overlapping chain; the nonoverlapping pieces at the beginning and end of the chain form another word or phrase. For example: ONE = _padre_, TWO = _retrench_, THREE = _trenchant_, FOUR = _anthem_, FIVE = _hemlock_, LOCK = _padlock_.

A **lock and drop** is a padlock, except that the overlapping letters form a word. _Examples_: _lethal_, _halter_, _letter_, _Hal_; _tread_, _readier_, _tier_, _read_; and _coin_, _Indy_, _Cody_, _in_. The lock & drop was invented by Wabbit.

WILLz introduced the padlock, based on an Italian puzzle type, at the 1980 convention.


## Palindrome

A sentence or phrase is spelled the same forward as backward; for example, _Draw pupil's lip upward_. An accompanying verse provides clues.

    PALINDROME (4 4 7!)
    Quiche Lorraine?
    Oh, not again!
    =Tut

The solution: _Drat such custard!_


## Pasteover

A letter moves from its original position in a word and takes the place of another letter; the letter that has been "pasted over" is deleted. Example: _Ian Fleming_,  \
_inflaming_. 


## Phonetic flats

Puzzle variations in which sounds are the basic unit instead of letters. An example of a **phonetic beheadment**: ONE = _quest_, TWO = _west_; a **phonetic charade**: ONE = _lox_, TWO = _myth_, WHOLE = _locksmith_; a **phonetic curtailment**: ONE = _cute_, TWO = _queue_. In a phonetic curtailment, TWO can be longer than ONE; what counts is the number of sounds, not the number of letters. In fact, the greater the change in spelling, the more interesting the base.

A flat is phonetic if any part is phonetic, even if some parts are not. For example: ONE = _weigh_, TWO = _ding_, ALL = _wading_. No flat is labeled phonetic if it can also work as a letter-based puzzle. _Mite_/_rite_ is both a first-letter change and a first-sound change, but it is called a first-letter change. _Mite_/_right_ has to be a first-sound change.

The underlined letters, as pronounced in the following words, stand for single sounds: _l<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ou</span>d_, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ch</span>in_, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">wh</span>ale_, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">j</span>oke_, _si<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ng</span>_, _c<span style="text-decoration:underline;">oi</span>n_, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">sh</span>ip_, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">th</span>in_, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">th</span>is_, _vi<span style="text-decoration:underline;">si</span>on_. These sounds are indivisible. On the other hand, these represent two sounds: _f<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ew</span>_ and _c<span style="text-decoration:underline;">u</span>rable_. The _y_ and _oo_ sounds are separate.

Modern pronunciation varies widely; you're likely to encounter phonetic flats that don't work in your speech. They are still legal and valid as long as MW substantiates their pronunciation.

These pronunciation variations are common enough to be acceptable without comment in flats:

 

    _w_ = _hw_. For most Americans, _where_ and _wear_ are homonyms.

    For many Americans, T and D have the same sound between two vowels if the second vowel is unstressed; _latter_ and _ladder_ are homonyms.

    _ä_ = _ _= __. For most Americans, _bother_ rhymes with _father_. For a minority, _cot_ is a homonym of _caught_.

    Before a vowel sound, _ār_ = _er_ = _ar_. Many Americans pronounce _Mary_ and _merry_ the same, and a large minority pronounce _marry_ the same as the other two. 11C is not consistent on this point; NI3 explains it. Phonetic flats based on this pronunciation are not tagged "NI3 pronunciation."

    _r_ = schwa or nothing. For many r-droppers, _card_ and _cod_ are homonyms, as are _manners_ and _mannas_.

    schwa = short _i_, most often unstressed.   For many, _language_ and _languid_ are a last-sound change.

For more information, see the next word in the puzzle's name.


## Phrase shift

A well-known phrase (often not a dictionary entry) is altered by shifting one letter to another position to form a new phrase (almost never a dictionary entry). The cueword stands for the new phrase only; solvers must deduce the original phrase from a clue hidden somewhere in the verse. Ideally, the way the letters in the phrase are divided into words changes after the shift.

    PHRASE SHIFT (3 2 1 7)
    'Twas the week after Christmas and Carol, a clerk,
    Was stopped by a guard when returning to work.
    "We've got a new system," he said with a chortle.
    "Only high-level workers may come through this portal—
    It's the ANSWER PHRASE uses! To enter the store,
    Mere flunkies like you must employ the back door."
    =Xemu

The solution: _way in a manager_ (from "Away in a Manger," clued in the verse by "Christmas . . . Carol"). Anther example: _don't judge a brook by its cove_.

Other variations, like the phrase metathesis, have also been printed; in theory, any flat type where there's only a small difference between ONE and TWO could be the basis for a phrase puzzle. Introduced by Mr. Tex in July 1998.


## Picture flats

The solution words are clued by elements shown in an illustration rather than in verse. Note that the solution words need not be nouns; actions and qualities of things or actions depicted can also serve as clues to verbs, adjectives, or adverbs.


## Popover

Two letters in a solution are switched while one changes. **Examples**: _captor_, _carton_; _validate_, _salivate_. Introduced by Typger and Next Lingo in May 2015.


## Progressive puzzles

See the next word in the puzzle's name.


## Qaqaqesqe

A modifier of other flats, like "phonetic." (Qaqaq doesn't write U's after Q's.). A Qaqaqesqe letter change on _pick_ for a word clued as 'rapid' would make _qick_ (which would be enumerated 4 but treated for tagging purposes as _quick_). The Qaqaqesqe was named by Qaqaq. 


## Quantum flats

Offers a single word (not a homographic or homophonous pair) that has at least two spellings or two pronunciations; the meaning of the word does not change. The same orthographic transformation is applied to each spelling or the same phonetic transformation is applied to each pronunciation to yield new words. The quantum word is enumerated in <angle brackets>. A cueword in the verse represents every form of the quantum word, but it is not overloaded because it represents a single word. Example: Quantum Transposal (<4>, 4; <4>, 4) → _icon_, _coin_; _ikon_, _oink_. 


## Rebade

A hybrid of the rebus and alternade. The reading of the rubric (these terms are explained under rebus) is divided into two or more shorter words by taking alternate letters in order. For example, the rubric might be **RBF ~~H~~ T** with the reading being _RBF, eliminated H, see T_. The three parts, obtained by taking every third letter of the reading, would be ONE = _remade_, TWO = _blithe_, THREE = _finest_. These parts would be clued in the accompanying verse. Here's another example:

    REBADE (4, 4, 3)


6
     
    My shoulders THREE; my face grows ashen:
    TWO mini—enter ONE! says fashion.
    =Treesong

The solution: ONE = _midi_, TWO = _exit_, THREE = _sag_. Write the solution letters alternately to make the rubric reading appear: _me: six, a digit_.

For more information, see Solving and Composing the Rebus and Rebade.

In the **subade** (suber alternade—see suber), the reading is reversed before being divided into shorter words or phrases. For example, **TLGHG** gives the reading:  \
_set T before L, G, H, ge_. Reversed and divided: ONE = _egret_, TWO = _globe_, THREE = _hefts_.

 
    SUBADE (5, 5)
     


h p
     
    His maladroitness plagued him
    Till he wished that he were dead.
    He tried to TWO his wrists, but missed,
    And cut his ONE instead.
    =Treesong

 

The solution: ONE = _palms_, TWO = _slash_. (The reading: _h's small as p_.)

The rebade was invented by Treesong in January 1974.


## Rebus

(This is only a basic description of the rebus; there is much more discussion and detail in the separate article, Solving and Composing the Rebus and Rebade.)

A word or phrase is represented by letters, numbers, or symbols; their positions; and sometimes related letter-play, like alterations to the verse.

For example, the word _abalone_—read as _a B alone_—might be represented by: **B**. The phrase _damper sand_—read as _D, ampersand_—might be represented by: **D&**. The phrase _forge a check_—read as _for GE, a check_—might be represented by a verse in which the letter pair _ge_ was replaced once, or everywhere it appeared, by ✓. Here are two examples:

 
    REBUS (5 4)
     
    **	PBR**
     
    The cutest thing, by far,
    Must be the PBR.
    I'm sure that I am right—
    It's clearly black and white.
    =Mr. Tex

 

The solution: _panda_ _bear (P and a be, ar). _As the example shows, rebus solutions need not be MW phrases; in fact, they rarely are.

 
    REBUS [10 5] (NI3)
     
             C
            NT
             G
     
    What's a WHOLE?
    It's a mole.
    =Brillig

 

The solution:  _undercover_ _agent (under C, over a G, en, T)._

The letters, numbers, or symbols indicating the solution (such as **B** or **D&** in the examples above) are called the rubric. The explanation of the solution (such as _a B alone_ or _for GE, a check_) is called the reading of the rubric. Note that (except in phonetic rebuses) the reading is generally a heteronym of the solution. On the solution page, the editor may explain the readings of difficult rebuses.

If a reading has a word not in 11C, this is indicated by a tag like "NI2 phrase in reading" or "reading has an NI3 word with non-MW usage." The solution, the reading, and even the rubric (perhaps having an NI2 diagram or symbol) may be tagged.

Rubrics are roughly centered and between the flat's title and verse, unless a reading indicates otherwise.

In a **phonetic rebus**, part or all of the reading is sounded out to give the solution. For example, **II** represents _two black eyes_ (_two black I's_); **HEE** is _ate cheese_ (_aitch, E's_);  \
**E** is _usury_ (_use your E_).

The **enigmatic rebus** is not a specific puzzle type. Rather, "enigmatic" is a red flag, warning you that the reading involves something other than simple manipulation of letters.

A typical enigmatic rebus requires that you infer missing parts, as in **E** for _eggnogs_ (_EGG; no G's_). Or you may have to recognize letters as symbols (as in **BASiS** =  \
_basilicons_ = _B, A, silicon, S_).

The distinction between enigmatic and nonenigmatic isn't black and white, hard and fast, or cut and dried. (Solvers, like editors, will find this to be tried and true.) Many once-enigmatic devices, through convention and familiarity, have come to be accepted as nonenigmatic. These include letters used as various symbols and abbreviations. Please see Solving and Composing the Rebus and Rebade for a much fuller discussion.

A **phonigmatic rebus** is a rebus that is both phonetic and enigmatic.

In the **progressive rebus**, the solution to one rebus is the rubric for another. For example, **OR** could be the rubric for a two-part solution: ONE = _odor_ (_O; do R_), TWO (with rubric ODOR) = _outside the door_ (_outside the DO, OR_). One or more parts of a progressive rebus may be enigmatic, phonetic, or phonigmatic; each rebus is labeled and tagged separately.

The **suber** is a reversed rebus, as reversing its name will show. The reading of a suber is a reversed heteronym of the solution. For example, **K,H** could be the rubric for a suber with the solution _hammock_ (a reversal of _K, comma, H_). Like a rebus, a suber can be enigmatic, phonetic, phonigmatic, or progressive.

 
    SUBER (12)
     
        ~~O~~ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">P</span>
     
    A WHOLE of vanilla is all it would take
    To bring to perfection the taste of your cake.
    =Treesong

 

The solution: _dessertspoon_ (_no O, P stressed_).

An example of a **progressive suber**: rubric **C + I**, ONE = _music_ (_CI sum_), TWO (rubric MUSIC) = _coliseum_ (_MU, es, I; lo! C_).


## Reduplication

The first half of the solution is a heteronym of the second half. Examples: _edited it_ ; or _in pain, pa_. Further replications are possible: a triplication has also been published. 


## Repeated-letter change

A word or phrase becomes another when one letter is changed to another letter wherever it appears (the letter must appear at least twice). Examples: _monocle_, _manacle_; or _crochet_, _prophet_.

A repeated-letter change may have more than two parts. Example: _skunk_, _stunt_, _sauna_; the same positions must have changed letters to form all other parts.

As is true of similar types (like the spoonergram, transposal, reversal, and letter-change), the repeated-letter change must work in both directions—that is, be  \
reversible. For example, _puffy_ cannot be changed to _puppy_, because reversing the change would produce _fuffy_, not the original _puffy_.

The repeated-letter change was introduced by WILLz in 1980.


## Repeated-letter deletion

See deletion.


## Reversal

A word or phrase becomes another when reversed. Examples: _desserts_, _stressed_; and _de trop_, _ported_.

In the **bigram reversal**, two-letter chunks are reversed instead of single letters. There aren't many of these; one example is _se-ra-ph_, _ph-ra-se_.

If one or both parts are not dictionary entries, the puzzle is not a reversal but a mynoreteh (which see).


## Reversed puzzles

A variation of a puzzle in which you have to reverse the result to read the final solution.

If the puzzle involves a single operation on one word or phrase to produce another, you reverse the result of the operation to get the second part. Thus, _petal_, _late_ is an example of a reversed beheadment (first you behead, then you reverse).

If the puzzle involves breaking a word or phrase into two or more parts, you assemble the parts first, and then reverse the result, to get the whole word or phrase. Thus, ONE = _red_, TWO = _rum_, WHOLE = _murder_ is an example of a reversed charade (first you join the parts, then you reverse the result).

A reversed rebus is called a suber (which see).

A reversed** **heteronym is called a mynoreteh (which see).

For more information, look up the next word in the puzzle's name.


## Riddle

Something is described enigmatically in verse. Riddles are not enumerated—any synonym of the solution is acceptable as long as it satisfies the clues. A riddle describing a matchstick, for example, can also be answered with "a match."

 
    RIDDLE
     
    He fixes crowns of kings, I'm told,
    When they are showing wear.
    He patches them with shiny gold;
    He's expert at repair.
    You needn't be a monarch, though—
    He'll also fix your cap.
    But though at work he's quite a pro,
    He's still a boring chap.
    =Manx

 

The solution: _a dentist._

There is no hard and fast distinction between the riddle and the enigma (which see). Generally, a riddle describes a thing and an enigma a word; riddles have deceptive descriptions, enigmas some form of wordplay. An occasional flat can fairly be classified as either.


## Secession

One word or phrase becomes another when one or more US postal abbreviations are removed, wherever they occur. Examples: _(in)(sc)(ri)be_; _pen(ny) (ar)(ca)(de)_; and _ro(ma)(nc)e_. (A Canadian secession, using Canadian provincial postal abbreviations, is also possible.) The secession was invented by Murdoch and introduced in May 2006. 


## Singularity

Each pair of double letters in the first answer is replaced by a single occurrence of that letter. Examples: _possess_, _poses_ and _access_, _aces_.

The singularity was Invented by LeXman and Lirath and introduced in August 2009.


## Sound change

One sound is changed in a word or phrase to make another. Example: _tungsten_, _tonguester_ (a last-sound change).

 
    FOURTH-SOUND CHANGE (7, 6)
     
    Detroit announces this year's line:
    Three compact cars all named for TWOs!
    (How chic, you say? Of course!) You'll pine
    For our new Peanut. (Cheap!) Or choose
    Our two-door hatchback Pea. (It's small
    But loaded!) Need more ONE, you say?
    We've built a car to suit the tall:
    Test-drive a String Bean Coupe today!
    =Trazom and Uncanny

 

The solution: ONE = _legroom_, TWO = _legume_.

In a **terminal-sound change**, the first and last sounds of a word are both changed. Example: _four-star_, _doorstop_. 

See also the discussion of what constitutes a single sound, under phonetic flats.


## Sound shift

See LETTER SHIFT.


## Split shift

Two (or more) base words start and end with identical sequences of letters. Linking the dissimilar parts makes another word. Examples: _elegant_, _element_, _game_ [appears as "ele-ga/me-nt"]; and _t-ak/in-e_; _co-v/ast-er_. 


## Spoonergram

A phrase (or, less commonly, a word) becomes another when the initial consonant sounds in its component words (or stressed syllables) are swapped. Spoonergrams are always phonetic; spelling may change. Examples: _Morse code_, _course mowed_; or _key ring_, _reeking_. Note: unlike most flat bases, those of spoonergrams don't have to be dictionary entries.

 
    SPOONERGRAM (9, 5 *4) (*4 not MW)
     
    "That TWO bit, no-good grouchy cuss
    That he is, is at the door."
    "Oh, Henry, is he suing us?"
    "Why, no, pet, fret no more.
    He called to say he'd bring us, dear,
    A ONE he took of me
    The day that twister threw me clear
    Into the apple tree."
    =Joker

 

The solution: ONE = _telephoto_, TWO = _fella Toto_.

For a list of sounds considered single and indivisible, see phonetic flats.

Although the spoonergram usually involves swapping two sounds or sound clusters, sometimes only one sound actually moves. Examples: _four inches_, _or finches_; or _trained seal_, _strained eel_. Since the spoonergram is purely a phonetic flat, word boundaries needn't be preserved. For example, if ONE is _White Plains_, TWO may be either _plight wanes_ or _ply Twain's_, since the two are phonetically the same. Another example: _deer wakes_, _weird aches_.

Not every word in the spoonergram need change. Example: _rake over the coals_, _cake over the rolls_. Words that don't change are noted with the puzzle.

Sometimes more than two words are involved in the swapping of sounds. Example: _cold sailor rowed the tipping boat_, _bold tailor sewed the ripping coat_.

Many possible spoonergram variations are made by swapping sounds other than the initial consonants. (Example: _light red_, _let ride_, swapping vowels.)   Provide an example with each puzzle of this sort, so that the solver knows which sounds are swapped.

In a **phrase spoonergram**, a familiar phrase (which does not appear in the verse or the solution) is spoonerized to form a new phrase. The original phrase is in some way hinted at by the verse. Example: _the shaming of the true_ [_The Taming of the Shrew_]. 

The spoonergram was introduced by Emmo W. in March 1945.


## Subade

Short for "suber alternade." See rebade.


## Suber

A reversed rebus (which see).


## Superfluity

Contains a extraneous word in the body of the flat; if the word is removed, the flat still makes sense. The word indicates how to change one solution word into the other solution word. The superfluous word is not enumerated. Examples: _face_, _surface_ ["surplus" extraneous]; _stable_, _able_ ["stout" extraneous]; and _appeal_, _appal_ ["cute" extraneous]. 


## Swap flats

In a **chop 'n' swap**, a letter is removed (chopped) from somewhere in the middle of a word or phrase; the two pieces remaining switch positions (swap). Examples: _shame_ → chop the "a" → swap the parts → _mesh_; and _ta(f)fies_.

In a **phonetic chop 'n' swap**, a word or phrase becomes another when one sound is deleted (chopped) from somewhere inside, leaving two pieces, which are phonetically swapped. Example: _rucksack_, _crooks_.

In a **word chop 'n' swap**, a word is deleted from a longer one, and the remaining pieces are interchanged to form a third word. Example: _le(vita)ting_. Invented by Badir and introduced in January 2008.

In a **change 'n' swap**, an internal letter is changed (not deleted) to another letter, and the strings on either side switch places to form another word or phrase the same length as the original. Examples: _cleric_, _icicle_; _blessing_, _singable_. Invented by Tinhorn and introduced in November 2008.

In a **hack 'n' back**, a letter is removed from somewhere in the middle of a word or phrase. The second remaining piece is reversed and appended to the first piece. Examples: _miter_ → hack the "t" → reverse the second part → _mire_; _seat belt_, _Seattle_. 


## Switchback

See backswitch.


## Telestichal enigma

A telestichal enigma is like an acrostical enigma, except that the part-words overlap the ends of the lines (by at least two letters), not the starts.

 
    TELESTICHAL ENIGMA (6)
     
    Y.  I don't know the name of this "flower from Gaza";
        It goes in this square (it's a form, not a plaza).
     
    Z.  Forgive the transition: I've nothing but boos
        For the strange obscure words that the formist must use.
     
    When I don't know the words, and I don't have a clue,
    What National Puzzlers' form can I do?
    =Tahnan

 

The solution: Part-words: aza_LEA_, se_GUE;_  answer = _LEAGUE_ ("what National Puzzlers form").

The telestichal enigma was reintroduced to the NPL by Dart with information on past use from Trash.


## Terminal deletion

A word or phrase is changed to another by removing its first and last letters. Examples: _foregone_, _Oregon_; or _self-worth_, _elfwort_ (a plant). If both parts are single words, only the longest is enumerated; otherwise, both parts are enumerated.

**Progressive terminal deletions** contain more than two words or phrases; they are rare. A simple example: _lament_, _amen_, _me_.

In a **phonetic terminal deletion**, a word or phrase is changed to another by removing its first and last sounds. Example: _kwacha_ (a Zambian coin), _watch_. Only the enumeration of the first part is given.

In a **reversed terminal deletion**, a word or phrase is changed to another by removing its first and last letters and reversing the result. Example: _rebirth_, _tribe_.

In a **terminal palindrome deletion**, a word or phrase becomes another when the initial string of characters is a reversal of the final string (together they form a palindrome) and deleting these two strings leaves the shorter answer, which is not enumerated. Examples: _(en)gi(ne)_, _GI_; _(Lak)e Bay(kal)_, _eBay_; and _(de)bunk(ed)_, _bunk_. 


## Terminal rotation

A pair of words becomes another pair of words when all four terminal letters shift position, in a manner analagous to rotating tires on a car: each front letter moves to the end, while the back letters move in front and switch words. Examples: _tend_, _bums_, _sent_, _dumb_; _dapper_, _sought_, _tapped_, _roughs_; _taps_, and _lair_, _rapt_, _sail_.

The terminal rotation was invented by Bartok and introduced in August 1998. 


## Transaddition

This flat type is always done as a transdeletion. But see also the group flats heading and the following two exceptions.

In a **Rochester transaddition**, each letter in a word is added back to the word, in order, and the result transposed. Examples: _nacre_; _canner_, _arcane_, _cancer_, _craner_, _careen_; _scare_; _caress_, _scarce_, _Caesar_, _racers_, _crease_; and _heart_; _hearth_, _heater_, _Aretha_, _rather_, _threat_.

The Rochester transaddition was invented by Hap.

A **Bridgewater transaddition** is a generalization of the Rochester transaddition. You begin with an n-letter BASE word and an m-letter BANK word (note: n and m do not need to be equal). The other solution words are formed by transposing all the letters in BASE plus each of the m letters from BANK in turn. (A Rochester transaddition is a Bridgewater transaddition where BASE and BANK are the same word.) Example: BASE = _cast iron_, BANK = _atone_, ONE = _raincoats_, TWO = _tractions_, THREE = _consortia_, FOUR = _transonic_, FIVE = _creations_. Another example: BASE = _east_, BANK = _Xemu_, ONE = _Texas_, TWO = _tease_, THREE = _teams_, FOUR = _saute_.

The Bridgewater transaddition was invented by Xemu, named by Meki, and introduced in January 1996.


## Transade

A word or phrase is broken up into two or more shorter parts. Each shorter part is transposed (separately) to make a word. (Thus the name: TRANSposed charADE.) Examples: _solution_, _soul_, _into_; or _Washington_, _saw_, _nothing_. At the editor's discretion, the shorter parts may be enumerated.

The transade was invented Dirty Jack and introduced in October 1992.


## Trans-cross

A trans-cross is similar to a double-cross (which see), but the pieces of the word switch AB, CD, AC, BD. For example: _seal_, _rely_, _sere_, _ally._

 
    TRANS-CROSS (*3-*5, 6, 8, 6) (TEAS, EH, TEE, ASH)
     
    Sing a song of sixpence, a koan rather wry:
    EH of ASH arranged on a Zen master's pie.
    When he saw his pizza had four-and-twenty birds,
    He had the TEE assemble, and said some angry words
    (In some Tibeto-Burman tongue, or Tai, or TEAS;
    They all were South-East Asian—they weren't Japanese).
    "Within this monastery," he said, and waved his bat,
    " 'Make me one with everything' does not refer to that."
    =Ucaoimhu

 

The solution: TEAS = _Mon-Khmer_, EH = _oodles_, TEE = _monkhood_, ASH = _merles_.

The trans-cross was invented by Ucaoimhu.


## Transdeletion

A word or phrase becomes another when one letter is deleted and the others are transposed. A transdeletion must have at least four parts, each part one letter shorter than the one before. The cuewords are the lengths of the parts. For example: NINE = _righteous_, EIGHT = _roughest_, SEVEN = _troughs_, SIX = _sought_, FIVE = _ghost_, FOUR = _shot_. Another example: _carfares_, _carafes_, _fracas_, _scarf_.

Letters should be shuffled in each step. Avoid any simple deletions (or beheadments or curtailments). When unavoidable, they must be noted.

In the **Baltimore transdeletion**, a word or entry phrase is turned into a series of others by removing each letter in turn and rearranging the rest; the first letter is removed to form ONE, the second letter is removed to form TWO, and so on. For example: TOTAL = _baker_, ONE = _rake_, TWO = _kerb_, THREE = _bare_, FOUR = _bark_, FIVE = _beak_. Another example: WHOLE = _store_, ONE = _rote_, TWO = _rose_, THREE = _rest_, FOUR = _toes_, FIVE = _sort_.

The letters should actually be shuffled each time. Avoid simple deletions; note them with the puzzle if they do appear.


## Transpogram

A word or phrase becomes another when divided into two parts, which are interchanged. Examples: _rock-hard_, _hard rock_ (referring to the kind of music); or _fast break_, _breakfast_. Answers must be dictionary entries (or well known) but the parts need not be: for example, _alloy_, _loyal_.

A transpogram is most interesting if the parts have substantially different meanings. _Houseguest_ and _guest house_, for example, are a dull base. Since interesting bases are hard to come by, the transpogram has always been an uncommon type.

In the **phonetic transpogram**, the two parts that switch remain true to sound but not to spelling. Examples: _welfare_, _farewell_; or _Dear John_ (a kind of letter), _John Deere_ (a brand name); or _zero_, _rosy_.


## Transposal

A word or phrase becomes another when its letters are rearranged. Examples: _sleuth_, _hustle_; _Earl of Coventry_ (a children's card game), _olfactory nerve_. A transposal can have more than two parts, as in this example:  _blamed_, _beldam_, _ambled_, _bedlam_, _lambed_.

Certain special types of transposals have their own names: the **head-to-tail shift** (the first letter becomes the last), the **letter shift** (one letter moves to a new place), the **metathesis** (two letters exchange places), the **reversal** (the letter order is reversed), and the **transpogram** (a word or phrase is divided into two pieces, which exchange places). These are described under their own titles.

When a transposal contains more than two parts, two of them might form a special kind of transposal without that being noted. For example, in one of the preceding examples _beldam_ and _bedlam_ form a metathesis, but this needn't be mentioned with the puzzle.


## Trigram puzzles

Instead of single letters, trigrams (three-letter groups) are the basic unit of these puzzles. They work just as bigram puzzles do, but they use three-letter instead of two-letter groups.

For more information, look up the next word in the puzzle's name.


## Vowelcy

The vowels in each answer are the same and appear in the same order. Example: _malnourished_, _carrot juice_, _tambourine_, _andouille_. 


## Welded flats

A word or phrase is divided up into pieces (not usually words) that form a base of the given type. The solution need not be (and usually isn't) a dictionary entry, but the number of dictionary entries in the answer shouldn't be greater than the number of pieces in the base.  Example: the welded second-sound change _tech stocks._

 
    WELDED TRANSPOSAL (7 [6 3])
     
    Step up and vote for your favorite newt!
    (But do not stuff the ROOT BEER BOOT.)
    =Xemu

 

The solution_: axolotl ballot box_ (because "axolotlb" transposes to "allotbox"). Note that the solution consists of two dictionary entries even though it contains three words, because "ballot box" is an entry phrase.  (Note that the cuewords ROOT BEER BOOT are also a welded transposal.)

Most welded flats divide the solution into two pieces, but occasionally a welded flat with more pieces is seen—either because the given type of flat always has more than two solution words (a word deletion, for example), or because the type of flat sometimes has more than two (a transposal).

The place where the pieces are joined should fall within a word and not between words of the solution phrase (hence the term "welded").

Welded flats are an Italian puzzle type that Hot introduced to the NPL.


## Word deletion

A word or phrase is deleted from a longer one, leaving a third. Examples: TOTAL = _performance_, ONE = _man_, TWO = _perforce_ (shown as "perfor(man)ce");  \
_subt(rah)end_.  Only the length of the longest word or phrase is given.

If the cuewords are ONE and TWO, the inside word is ONE and the outside word is TWO. The same is true for other cueword pairs that have a natural order: FIRST goes inside SECOND. Avoid using a pair of cuewords (like HERE and THERE) that doesn't imply an order. Other common cuewords for word deletions are IN and OUT, INNER and OUTER, and WITHIN and WITHOUT. Cuewords like these are especially kind to the solver, since they clearly show which is the inside word.

In the **two-word deletion**, two consecutive words or phrases are deleted from a third to leave a fourth. Example: WHOLE = _organ-grinder_, ONE = _gang_, TWO = _rin_ (a Japanese coin), THREE = _order_ (shown as "or(gan-g)(rin)der").

Three-word deletions and more are possible.

In the **progressive word deletion**, three or more words are nested to form a longer one. ONE is always innermost. Example: WHOLE = _consecratory_, ONE = _Ra_, TWO = _sector_, THREE = _cony_. The progressive word deletion was invented by Tut and introduced in January 1973.

In a **transposed word deletion**, a string of consecutive letters within a word or phrase is transposed to produce one shorter word, and the remaining letters are transposed to form another. Examples: _b(oth)ered_ → _hot_, _breed_; _e(xam)ple_ → _max_, _peel_. 


## Word substitution

A word or phrase (ONE) contains a shorter one (TWO) within it; when this is removed and another (THREE) is substituted, a new word or phrase is formed (FOUR). Example: ONE = _wander_, TWO = _and_, THREE = _is_, FOUR = _wiser_. To save space on the solution page, this may appear as "w-and/is-er." Other examples: ONE = _Pandora_, TWO = _and/or_, THREE = _ark_, FOUR = _parka_; ONE = _consultant_, TWO = _sultan_, THREE = _sign-men_, FOUR = _consignment_. The enumeration of all parts is given.

If the smaller parts to be substituted are at the beginnings of the words, the puzzle is an **initial-word substitution**. For example: ONE = _pungent_, TWO = _pun_, THREE = _deter_, FOUR = _detergent_.

If the smaller parts to be substituted are at the ends of the words, the puzzle is a **final-word substitution**. For example: ONE = _Cleveland_, TWO = _land_, THREE = _rest_, FOUR = _cleverest_.

In an **extended-word substitution**, the shorter word is replaced more than once to form new words. For example: ONE = _list_, TWO = _is_, THREE = _en_, FOUR = _lent_, FIVE = _of_, SIX = _loft_.

The word substitution was invented by Alf.

In a **name change**, a substring in one of the solution words is a proper name and is replaced by another proper name to form another solution word. The proper names are not individually clued. Example: _Avalon_, _Avedon_ (substituting Ed for Al). The name change was invented by Quip and introduced in September 1992. 

In a **palindrome substitution** (aka **change**, **replacement**), a word or phrase becomes another when an internal palindromic string of three or more letters is replaced by another palindrome of at least three letters. Examples: _h(emme)r_, _h(ono)r_; and _L(umu)mba_, _L(a Ba)mba_. If the substitution is at the beginning, it's an **initial palindrome substitution**: _(Ede)n_, _(eve)n_. If the substitution is at the end, it's a **final palindrome substitution**: _b(elle)_, _b(anana)_; and _can(did)_, _Can(ada)_. f
